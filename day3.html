            <td>The potato (/pəˈteɪtoʊ/) is a starchy tuberous vegetable native to the Americas that is consumed as a
                staple food in many parts of the world. Potatoes are underground tubers of the plant Solanum tuberosum,
                a perennial in the nightshade family Solanaceae.

                Wild potato species can be found from the southern United States to southern Chile. Genetic studies show
                that the cultivated potato has a single origin, in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme
                northwestern Bolivia. Potatoes were domesticated there about 7,000–10,000 years ago from a species in
                the S. brevicaule complex. Many varieties of the potato are cultivated in the Andes region of South
                America, where the species is indigenous.</td>

            <td> The tomato (US: /təmeɪtoʊ/, UK: /təmɑːtoʊ/), Solanum lycopersicum, is a plant whose fruit is an edible berry that is eaten as a vegetable. The tomato is a member of the nightshade family that includes tobacco, potato, and chili peppers. It originated from and was domesticated in western South America. It was introduced to the Old World by the Spanish in the Columbian exchange in the 16th century.

                Tomato plants are vines, largely annual and vulnerable to frost, though sometimes living longer in greenhouses. The flowers are able to self-fertilise. Modern varieties have been bred to ripen uniformly red, in a process that has impaired the fruit's sweetness and flavor. There are thousands of cultivars, varying in size, color, shape, and flavor. Tomatoes are attacked by many insect pests and nematodes, and are subject to diseases caused by viruses and by mildew and blight fungi.</td>
